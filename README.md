K- Means Clustering
This project demonstrates the use of the K-Means Clustering algorithm to group similar data points into clusters. It is an unsupervised learning technique widely used in pattern recognition, market segmentation, customer behavior analysis, and more.

🔍 Features
Simple and intuitive explanation of K-Means

Implementation from scratch using Scikit-learn

Data visualization using Matplotlib

Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters

Works on real-world datasets (e.g., Iris dataset or custom datasets)

📁 Tech Stack
Python 🐍

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn

🚀 What this project does
Loads and explores a dataset

Normalizes the data (if needed)

Applies K-Means Clustering

Uses the Elbow Method to find the ideal number of clusters

Visualizes the resulting clusters with color-coded scatter plots

📌 Use Cases
Customer segmentation (e.g., by purchasing behavior)

Image compression

Grouping similar data points when labels are not known

Feature reduction and pattern discovery
